<h1>My Website and Tools</h1>


<h2><font size="5" color="green">Tell about how you made your site and why you chose the tools you did.  Briefly explain a challenge you experienced in setting up this site and how you solved it. </font></h2>

<p> <font size="4">Well honestly I used Jekyll to build my site because when I googled "Best Site Generator 2017" this was at the top of the page <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/05/25/top-ten-static-site-generators-of-2017/">here</a>
<br> I was originally going to setup my own theme, but due to time constraints I downloaded a theme and modified it to make it my own.  I did run into a couple small issues. One issue I had 
<br> was with the jekyll-paginate gem, but I was able to edit my gemfile and resolve the issue.  Most of the issues that I had were very minor and I was able to resolve them pretty quickly.
