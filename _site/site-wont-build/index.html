<h1>Site Won't Build</h1>


<h2><font size="5" color="green">A customer writes in saying their “site won’t build”.  Compose your best short (2-paragraph) customer-facing answer without any additional data, that could be useful 
<br>in the generic case but would also lead to a customer providing a more actionable response.

<p> <font size="4">  In order to provide you with the help that you need we would like you to provide us with as much information as possible about your issue.  When was the last time you attempted a build?  I just   
<br> want to make sure there weren't any environmental issues occurring during your attempt.  What build tools and what versions are you using for your site?  Have you had the chance to   look through    
<br> any of the logs; if so, did you find any errors?   Is there any additional relevant information that you can provide us to help resolve your issue?
