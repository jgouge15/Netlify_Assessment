<h1>Suggestions</h1>


<h2><font size="5" color="green">Could you give us a suggestion to improve this test or the job posting? </font></h2>

<p>  <font size="4">I think the test and the job posting were fine.  For recruiting purposes if there was anything I would add to the job posting it would be be to add some of the perks and benefits of the job.  I think that can help
<br> in a couple of different ways.  For some people the perks of a startup can sometimes outweigh other factors like money.  For others listing the benefits like health insurance, PTO, etc.. can help to give a sense of security.  
<br> When I saw the posting and looked into the company I thought it sounded like an awesome job with a chance to learn something new, but the first words out of my wife's mouth when I mentioned the job were "What are the benefits".   
<br> As far as the test goes I think that its definitely a good way of determining what people know.  I would maybe make it a little more streamlined in this case because there are a lot of different ways of going about it and 
<br> people can easily get off track and spend several hours on just one aspect of it.
