<h1>Major DNS Challenges for The End User</h1>


<h2><font size="5" color="green">Explain, in a couple of paragraphs, what you think 2 major challenges around DNS configuration are for less-technical internet end-users </font></h2>

<p> <font size="4"> DNS configuration can be very intimidating to less technical end users.  Things like DNS Forward lookup zones, reverse lookup zones, DNS records are completely alien to most end users.  For someone new to 
<br> even get started they are going to need some help from someone with experience or need some training or specialized instructions.  Another barrier for a new comer is the fear of how any mistakes that are made
<br> could seriously damage the environment if not handled correctly.
</font></p>
<p>  <font size="4"> The other aspect of DNS is IP addresses and how they are used within DNS management.  A user is going to have to have some familiarity with IP addresses in order to perform any DNS configuration.   
<br> End users don't typically see an IP address, they just see the domain name, such as google.com. They don't ever see those IP addresses associated with those names.  New comers to DNS will have to have or get the 
<br> knowlege necessary to make the appropriate changes regarding IP address within DNS configuration.
