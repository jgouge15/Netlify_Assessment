<h1>Favorite Thing About Technical Support</h1>


<h2><font size="5" color="green">What is your favorite thing about providing technical support? </font></h2>

<p> <font size="4"> For me Technical Support is the best of both worlds.  I'm always itching to get my hands on the newest tech and if my wife weren't in my life to reign me in I would probably be broke.  
I also love helping people and <br> teaching them the benefits of technology.  I am a people pleaser, which has pros and cons, but in Tech support its a huge plus.  I'll never stop until the customer is 
happy and I'll always make sure my team has what it <br> 
needs from me not because its my job, but because I enjoy it.
