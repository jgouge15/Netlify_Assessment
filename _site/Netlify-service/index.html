<h1>Netlify Service</h1>


<h2><font size="5" color="green">What did you think of our service during the time you used it?  Be honest!  “it sucked” isn’t a wrong answer unless you don’t elaborate and provide some constructive criticism ;) </font></h2>

<p> <font size="4"> I've honestly never used anything like Netlify before and I loved it.  Even if I don't get the job I plan on using the service again and would recommend it to others. 
<br> I already have a few friends and family in mind that could definitely use it.  I loved the fact that it was so easy to launch the site and the configuration options that it gave me.
